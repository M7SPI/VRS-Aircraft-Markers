- VRS Custom Content Plugin installed and enabled.

##Instructions

- Clone or download the repo into a directory on the machine where VRS is running. Ensure you do not place the files under the Virtual Radar Server directory, since they could be overwritten on upgrades.
- Activate de plugin by adding a new entry in the Custom Content Plugin options, pointing out the .JS file and \Web folder.
- Enjoy!
