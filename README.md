Custom aircraft markers for Virtual Radar Server (a.k.a VRS). This plugin adds new markers and also highlights MLAT tracked aircrafts with different marker colors.

##Prerequisites
- VRS installed and running
- VRS Custom Content Plugin installed and enabled.

##Instructions
- Clone or download the repo into a directory on the machine where VRS is running. Ensure you do not place the files under the Virtual Radar Server directory, since they could be overwritten on upgrades.
- Activate de plugin by adding a new entry in the Custom Content Plugin options, pointing out the .JS file and \Web folder.
- Enjoy!
